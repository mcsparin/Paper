Introduction
============

Programming languages, like all languages, evolve over time in response to the changing needs and demands of the people using them.  In the realm of computer programming, potential language changes often begin with some form of a change proposal. Each language has its own particular version of a change proposal, but the underlying idea tends to be basically the same.  In essence, a change proposal provides documentation that allows the community of user to discuss and evaluate proposed alterations before ultimately deciding whether or not they merit inclusion in future versions of the language.  In the Scala programming language, formal changes are proposed via Scala Improvement Processes, or SIPs.  SIP 18: Modularizing Language Features was initially proposed on March 17, 2012 and later accepted for inclusion in the release of Scala 2.10.0.  Consideration of SIP 18's impact on the Scala language and its use will be the focus of the following investigation.

Being that Scala is still in its infancy, its domain of usefulness has not been decided by the CS community. Developers continue to modify and improve its features, tailoring syntax and functionality to handle a variety of solution techniques in an effort to solidify Scala as a general-purpose programming language. Most general-purpose languages are packaged with a variety of Domain-Specific (DS) libraries like those for symbolic math and arbitrary-precision computation, but, unlike Scala, you must explicitly import them into the environment.
